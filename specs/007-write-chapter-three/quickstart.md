# Quickstart: Creating a New Chapter 3 Topic File

This guide outlines the process for creating a new topic file within Chapter 3 ("Advanced Topics in Robotics"), adhering to the established structure and quality requirements.

## Steps:

1.  **Navigate to the Chapter 3 Directory**:
    *   Locate the Chapter 3 directory within the `ai-native-book/docs` structure: `ai-native-book/docs/03-chapter-three/`.

2.  **Create a New Markdown File**:
    *   Inside the Chapter 3 directory, create a new Markdown file (`.md`). The filename should be descriptive, lowercase, and use hyphens for spaces (e.g., `rl-robot-behaviors.md`). This file will serve as a sibling to the `index.md` and other topic files in that directory.

3.  **Populate with Content**:
    *   Open the newly created `.md` file.
    *   Add a suitable title using an H1 heading (`# Your Topic Title`).
    *   Write the complete, detailed, page-level content for the topic.
        *   **Word Count**: Aim for 800-1200 words.
        *   **Content Quality**: Ensure it is research-based, deeply written, contextually aligned with "Advanced Topics in Robotics," and assumes full understanding of Chapters 1 and 2 fundamentals.
        *   **Flow**: Maintain a clear, logical, progressive flow from Chapters 1 and 2.
        *   **Elements**: Provide depth, examples, explanations, and where appropriate, use illustrative examples/hypothetical scenarios as a fallback for case studies.
    *   Maintain the consistent writing style and professional formatting observed in previous chapters.

4.  **Add to Docusaurus Sidebar (Optional but Recommended)**:
    *   While the `sidebars.ts` is `autogenerated`, ensuring `index.md` contains links or an ordered list of topics can help navigation if the autogeneration order isn't precise. For explicit control, manual updates to `sidebars.ts` might be considered if the autogeneration doesn't meet exact ordering requirements. Otherwise, simply ensuring the files are in the `03-chapter-three` directory will make them discoverable.

5.  **Review Content Quality**:
    *   Perform a manual review of the new topic file to ensure it meets all writing quality requirements (FR-005 to FR-010) and the success criteria (SC-004, SC-005) from the `spec.md`. Pay close attention to word count, foundational approach, and use of illustrative examples.

This process ensures that new topic files for Chapter 3 are correctly integrated into the Docusaurus structure and maintain the desired content quality and academic rigor.
